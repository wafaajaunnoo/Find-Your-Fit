# Find Your Fit

Find Your Fit is a web application designed to help users create a personalized gym membership experience. With features such as account creation, profile management, trainer selection, progress tracking, and feedback, users can easily find the right trainer/coach and monitor their fitness journey.

- **Account Creation and Login:** Users can create a new account and log in to access the features of the web application. Account creation requires basic information such as name, email, and password.

- **Profile Management:** Users can update their profile information, including personal details, fitness goals, and preferences. This information helps in matching users with suitable trainers and providing personalized recommendations.
